# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This is a **single-context** repo.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates the glossary lazily when terms get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## No ADRs

This repo does not use architecture decision records. Never create an ADR file or an adr directory, even when a skill offers one. Record a decision's lasting rules in the doc that owns the area (for example `docs/slack-integration.md`) and its vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md`.
